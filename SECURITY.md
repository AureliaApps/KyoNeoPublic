## Reporting a Vulnerability

Depending on the severity of the vulnerability, the report process is different, since Kyo isn't cloud based in nature, and in the future when cloud-sync is enabled, it will be using CloudKit, which is an Apple service. For security vulnerabilities pertaining to CloudKit, please contact Apple directly for responsible disclosure.

For any security concerns about Kyo (the app itself), you can open an issue on GitHub or [click here](https://github.com/AureliaApps/KyoNeoPublic/security/advisories/new). Please keep in mind these reports are public, so please keep the report professional and only include information necessary to your report.
