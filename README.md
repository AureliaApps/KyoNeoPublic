<!-- OLD TITLE
# Kyo - School App
### School Planner and Lesson Planner
-->

## About Kyo
Kyo is an all-in-one comprehensive school and lesson planner for iOS devices. 

Using the Planner tool, you are able to organise and schedule your classes to ensure you arrive on time, all the time. 

Using the Tasks tool, you are able to map out and visualise your tasks and prioritise what's important.

#### What is Kyo Built with?
Kyo is written in fully native Swift and SwiftUI for iOS devices. This ensures the most optimal performance and a stable experience.
